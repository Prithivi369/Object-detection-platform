### Prerequisites:
- Ensure that **Java** is installed (version 11 or higher).
- Install **JavaFX** for GUI components if not already installed.
- Install the required **DLL** and **VAR** files for the project.

### Dependencies:
1. **DLL Files and VAR FILES (or other resources):**
   - Download and place the necessary DLL files(openCV) in the project's root folder or the appropriate directory and same with the VAR files:

### Setup Instructions:
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Ensure all dependencies (DLL files, VAR files, libraries) are downloaded and placed in the correct directories.
3. Open the project in your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).
4. Modify any file paths in the source code to match your local system setup.
5. Run the `Main.java` file located at `src/frontend/gui/Main.java`.

###Common Issues:
1. Issue with DLL loading: Make sure the DLLs are placed in the same directory as the project or in a directory that's included in the PATH environment variable.
2. JavaFX errors: If you face JavaFX-related errors, make sure the correct version is installed, and the SDK paths are properly set in the IDE.
